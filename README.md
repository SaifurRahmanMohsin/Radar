# Radar #
Locator component for determining closest path to user location for OctoberCMS

# What is it #
A growing organization will have more than one branch to serve it's customers. This component helps in order to make it easy for customers to locate the nearest branch. It uses Google's distance matrix API to determine the closest of several branches to the customer's location and direct the user to find the right way to the nearest branch.

# Current Status #
Code for RADAR locating yet to be added.

# Where can RADAR be used? #
* Brand websites so that users can find the closest branch / outlet to their preferred brand.
* Emergency services web app such as hospital, police station so that user can find the one nearest to them.

## TODO ##
* Toggle switch to use HTML5 Geolocation API instead of asking user to input address.
* Map to enhance the experience while adding the addresses in backend.
* Add composer.json and switch to netresearch/jsonmapper instead of array_map.
* Enhancement Idea: Group ID component dropdown attribute to support multiple organizations.
