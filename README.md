# Radar #
Locator component for determining closest path to user location for OctoberCMS

# What is it #
A growing organization will have more than one branch to serve it's customers. This component helps in order to make it easy for customers to locate the nearest branch. It uses Google's distance matrix API to determine the closest of several branches to the customer's location and direct the user to find the right way to the nearest branch. 

# Current Status #
Created component to display the form field. Code for RADAR locating yet to be added. Simple routing to single branch only is added for now.

## TODO ##
* Create the backend page to add addresses
* Add a switch to use location API instead of asking user to input address
* Enhancement Idea: Multiple companies with multiple branches using a unique ID for each company, user can pick the ID from component dropdown
